# Dotfiles-and-Scripts

## Description
Just like the repo name states, this is where I store my dotfiles and custom scipts
for my Arch Linux + i3 layout. I use the same config files on both laptops that I have
so far.

## Disclaimer
The wallpapers, overlay art and other images that I use are not in any way my property.
I only store them in my repo for easier access.

## Software Used
- ***i3-wm, i3status, i3lock*** - The basis of my mini ricefield
- ***picom*** - Effects such as transparency/opacity and window transition
- ***feh*** - Wallpaper setter
- ***imagemagick, scrot*** - Tools to setup my lockscreen
- ***alacritty*** - My default (favorite) terminal
